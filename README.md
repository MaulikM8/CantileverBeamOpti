# BeamOpti
Beam support location optimization for Cantilever Beam with UDL

This programe calculates support location for cantilever beam to reduce maximum bending moment.

To run this programe, put all the files in a folder where MATLAB path is set.
And enter 'runsim' in MATLAB command prompt.
It will ask you for Uniformaly Distributed Load on beam and Length of Beam.
Enter the asked data and Enjoy!!

Cheers!!
